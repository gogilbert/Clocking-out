# [Clocking Out](https://obsidiosteel.itch.io/clocking-out)
Tired after a long shift at work, you rest your head in the break room while waiting for the bus. When you wake up, you find out that you've overslept: the store is now closed, and you are "alone"...

Surely it's as simple as walking out the main entrance, right? If this isn't the case, you may need to find a second way out of the store. But, there's no reason you'd need to do this, and there's certainly no reason the manager would still be in the store with you...
